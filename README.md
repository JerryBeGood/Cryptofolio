# About

Cryptofolio is a IOS application. It's aim is to integrate services of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and give users a consistent interface for their use. Thanks to this it will be possible to play on many exchanges from one place, using one tool.

Currently Cryptofolio integrates two major exchanges on the market: Binance and ByBit.

Building blocks:
- [Server](https://github.com/JerryBeGood/Cryptofolio)
- [Mobile Application](https://github.com/justynazarzycka/Cryptofolio)
  
# Technologies

- Flask
- GraphQl
- Postgres
- SwiftUI

# Server setup

Start by creating python's virtual environment and installing dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you must take care of database setup.
Check brew for any updates and then install postregsql:

```
brew update
brew install postgresql
```

When that's finished you can start the database server:

```
brew services start postgresql
```

Now it time to create database for the project.
Run the configuration tool:

```
psql postgres
```


And start with creating our database admin:

```
CREATE ROLE admin 
WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin1' 
ALTER ROLE admin CREATEDB;
```

Use `\du` to check whether user exists.
Quit the tool with: `\q` and reconnect as the new user: 

```
psql postgres -U admin
```

Create the database for the server:

```
CREATE DATABASE cryptofolio;
```

Use `\l` to check if it exists.

If everything went well you can now go to projects home directory. Run python interactive interepreter in the terminal with `python3` and run this simple script for building database schema:

```
from cryptofolio import db 

db.create_all() 
db.session.commit() 
```

# Server Configuration

In cryptofolio directory along with routes.py, models.py and etc. you can find `init_config.py` which consists of empty configurational strings for our application. In order to deploy you need to create new configurational file e.g. `config.py` and fill it with configuration settings. 

Additional information on how to do it is avaible here:
- [Flask Mail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/)
- [Flask SqlAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)


# Server Start

After all setup and configuration steps have been done all you need to do to run Cryptofolio Server is to run app.py file from project's home directory. It requires two parameters:
- config_file: name of config file
- app_mode: --real or --test for interaction with testnet API of exchanges or the real one


```
python3 app.py config.py --real
```

Afterwards GraphQl API should be avaible at `localhost:5000/graphql`
