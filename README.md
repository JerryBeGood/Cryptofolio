# Server setup

Start by creating python's virtual environment and installing dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you must take care of database setup.
Check brew for any updates and then install postregsql:

```
brew update
brew install postgresql
```

When that's finished you can start the database server:

```
brew services start postgresql
```

Now it time to create database for the project.
Run the configuration tool:

```
psql postgres
```


And start with creating our database admin:

```
CREATE ROLE admin 
WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin1' 
ALTER ROLE admin CREATEDB;
```

Use `\du` to check whether user exists.
Quit the tool with: `\q` and reconnect as the new user: 

```
psql postgres -U admin
```

Create the database for the server:

```
CREATE DATABASE cryptofolio;
```

Use `\l` to check if it exists.

If everything went well you can know go to projects home directory. Run python interactive interepreter in the terminal with `python3` and run this simple script for building database schema:

```
from cryptofolio import db 

db.create_all() 
db.session.commit() 
exit()
```
